Cleaning data is the process of preparing raw data for analysis by addressing issues that can affect its quality and accuracy. 
The key steps involved in data cleaning include:
(i)Handling Missing Data: Identify and fill in, interpolate, or remove missing values to ensure completeness.
(ii)Removing Duplicates: Detect and eliminate duplicate records that can skew analysis results.
(iii)Standardizing Data: Ensure consistency in formatting, units of measurement, and categorical labels across the dataset.
(iv)Correcting Errors: Identify and fix any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data, such as typos or outliers.
(v)Handling Outliers: Detect and address outliers that can distort analysis, either by removing them or adjusting their impact.
